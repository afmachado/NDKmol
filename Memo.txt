* TODO

- !! In real device, changing representation sometimes leads to blank screen or crash
- !! ES 2.0 doesn't work on Android Simulator due to shader link error. It works on Nexus 7 (2013).
- !! Marching Squares doesn't work on Android real device!! (Mesh broken)

- Clean up NdkView.java (especially onDrawFrame)
- Build system for Android 1.6 (OpenGL ES 1.0)
  Now we have to edit GLES.hpp, Applicatin.mk, Android.mk, AndroidManifest.xml, NDKmolActivity.java

- Support screen rotation in Android

- Do we need glDisable(GL_CULL_FACE); ?
- Line does not use VBO yet

- Fix lighting (in ES2)
- Fix lighting (in ES1; VBOSphere doesn't preserve lighting settings?)
- Better matrix handling (transposed or not)
- Handle OpenGL context lost

- Refactor VBOSphere & VBOCylinder
- Refactor Sphere/Cylinder Geometory
   (remove static variables)
- Instancing for spheres and cylinders

- FPS monitor
- Autorotate
- Improve MatRenderer (reverse loop order for better cache hit)
- Interleaved array
- Reduce colors to UNSIGNED_BYTE * 3, not FLOAT * 4

- Better packing diagram (bring back to the cell)

- Fix loop
- Stereo
- Picker
- Labels
- Sequence view

* DONE

- Port to OpenGL ES 2.0 (almost DONE)
- Fix BAD_ACCESS error in VBO
    This was due to access to nVertices before initialization
- Make everything VBO (necessary for WebGL)
    But how much VRAM do we have?
    Can we kill vertexBuffer, etc after uploading it to VRAM?

* Supported platforms

OpenGL ES 2.0 : Almost all iOS, Android 2.2-
OpenGL ES 3.0 : iOS 7 with A7 core and higher, Android 4.3-
